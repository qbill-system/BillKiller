## Goals and Objectives

Creatinng innovative product which investing less but gaining more is our primary project goal!  
 
Bill Killer is a white-label product intensively designed for SMEs / startups in Food and Beverage industry, which facilitates placing dine-in / take-away orders, point-of-sale (POS) management and customer rela4onship management (CRMs) under very affordable cost.  

## Project Idea

Nowadays in most developed cities, the labor population in F&B industry is shrinking and so it is not surprising to experience no-one-can-serve scenario once taken a seat in a restaurant. Also, staff resource is insufficient for handling take-away call-ins during peak hours. Tablet food ordering system requires tremendous hardware investment and maintenance which is unaffordable to most startups. Moreover, they are also hard to be integrated with exis4ng POS systems.

Bill Killer the applications of cloud-based technology and mobile technology. It saves costs by fully utilizing customer’s smartphones, instead of relying on tablets installed on tables. End- users download an app from online app stores (iOS and Android) once and place the orders by either browsing in-app menu or scanning QR Codes on the menu, using their smartphones. When an order is made, it is printed on a paper with table number for dine-in or contact / delivery address for take-away. The staff can process the order as usual to their existing POS system if available, or manage the order via our built-in POS. This approach can significantly enhance the efficiency of placing orders with the least investment cost. Customers do not need to shake their hands and catch eye contacts with frontline staff again! 

At the same time, as the end-users already installed the app, the restaurants (our clients) can stay tuned with their customers (end-users) by featuring special offers / issuing coupons using Push notification technology natively built on smartphones. They can also browse the restaurant’s food menu and latest news of our clients anytime. 

## Current Stage of Development 

A prototype of QR Code scanning on mobile app is complete and the connection with the online database hosted in Amazon Cloud is fully functional. The printer can now print out the orders upon the online database. A full demonstration of ordering pipeline is ready.
