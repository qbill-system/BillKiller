[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YvzdNbAkFgY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YvzdNbAkFgY "Video demo")

## Goals and Objectives

Creatinng innovative product which investing less but gaining more is our primary project goal!  
 
Bill Easy is a white-label product intensively designed for SMEs / startups in Food and Beverage industry, which facilitates placing dine-in / take-away orders, point-of-sale (POS) management and customer relationship management (CRMs) under very affordable cost.  

## Project Idea

Nowadays in most developed cities, the labor population in F&B industry is shrinking and so it is not surprising to experience no-one-can-serve scenario once taken a seat in a restaurant. Also, staff resource is insufficient for handling take-away call-ins during peak hours. Tablet food ordering system requires tremendous hardware investment and maintenance which is unaffordable to most startups. Moreover, they are also hard to be integrated with existing POS systems.

Bill Easy the applications of cloud-based technology and mobile technology. It saves costs by fully utilizing customer’s smartphones, instead of relying on tablets installed on tables. End-users download an app from online app stores (iOS and Android) once and place the orders by either browsing in-app menu or scanning QR Codes on the menu, using their smartphones. When an order is made, it is printed on a paper with table number for dine-in or contact / delivery address for take-away. The staff can process the order as usual to their existing POS system if available, or manage the order via our built-in POS. This approach can significantly enhance the efficiency of placing orders with the least investment cost. Customers do not need to shake their hands and catch eye contacts with frontline staff again! 

At the same time, as the end-users already installed the app, the restaurants (our clients) can stay tuned with their customers (end-users) by featuring special offers / issuing coupons using Push notification technology natively built on smartphones. They can also browse the restaurant’s food menu and latest news of our clients anytime. 

## Social & Industrial Impact

The proposed system decouples the food-ordering decision making from when the customer enters the restaurant. It presents an interactive menu between the customer and the restaurant to minimize dispute.

With all the features enabled in the system, the customer can even browse and select the food from the electronic menu in his own mobile device before he physically enters the restaurant. After the customer enters the restaurant, the order will be received, confirmed and processed by the waitress. That saves some time the customer having to read and decide the order on site, and also provides the customers a better experience. In the long run, we are striving for promoting Pay It Forward system to local restaurants via Bill Easy for helping the needed individuals.

Bill Easy combines online mobile advertisement and order menu into single package. The menu is the advertisement on its own. The user can mock taking the order and estimate the cost in his mobile device before realizing the food. It also saves some time the customer spend on the table. And minimize dispute arises from the order.

The planorm also combines paper menu and phone order-taking in long run. The order can be taken to the restaurant and realized on site. Or simply by hikng delivery budon if the restaurant supports delivery service.

The proposed system is highly suitable for F&B industry with especially long and complex order, like fast food and sushi that take long list of individual items. In addition, it alleviates the problem of frontline labour shortage caused by the implementation of minimum wage in recent years.

## Competitive Analysis

Competition in traditional POS market targeted at F&B is keen. Indeed, most POS solution providers are not our direct competitors because Bill Easy can be treated as an add-on compatible with most existing POS systems, which has missions to further alleviate the shortage of labour resources and enhances the efficiency of the overall operation pipeline. In addition, none of solution providers promote a generalized solution which utilizes end-user’s smartphones for placing orders and at the same time undertaking CRM, so at this point, integration of mobile technology is definitely our unique advantage.

For online food delivery, there are two local websites: foodbyweb.com.hk and dialadinner.com.hk. They are online food ordering planorms providing some ways for food hunters to source take-away food all over Hong Kong. Comparing to our solution, we provide mobile app version and while-label app deployment services, so this will be our unique advantage too. 
 
For larger F&B enterprises, such as Itamae Sushi and Genki Sushi, they already have a complete dine-in food ordering system connected with their POS. They also invested big to have these specially designed solutions which are definitely unaffordable to F&B startups. That is the market niche of Bill Easy. We can provide this affordable generalised solutions to F&B startups. 

At this time, there are no obvious competitors in the market but only a similar one called web- on (asia) Ltd, with website hdp://www.web-on.com, can be highlighted here for exploration. Actually, it is a tailor-made solution provider and got a number of renowned clients. It provides online take-away ordering solutions and back-end supports for KFC , PizzaHut and PHD. Surely, their targeted clients can offer 6-digits development cost. Obviously, startups are not their cup of tea. Moreover, it does not provide native mobile take-away / dine-in order submissions and mobile CRM yet, so Bill Easy has a lot of rooms to explore in this extent.

## MarkeAng Strategy

At the very beginning, we will select a group of potential restaurant clients / startups. For the first year, we will support 10-100 of them to have a free trial in Bill Easy. The purpose is to accumulate success stories, so it will be a strong fact to convince the other targeted restaurants to believe our low-investment-high-profit rationale and invest on us. 

Primary target customers of Bill Easy are the startups / SMEs in F&B industry. In general, it is costly for them to have a solution that equips up with mobile app for placing dine-in / take-away orders, POS and CRM at the same time, so we may satisfy their financial need. In addition, most startups are more willing to try innovative approaches for gimmicks. 
 
For larger enterprises, they may also consider Bill Easy because it has no conflicts to their existing POS systems. If they are looking for a while-label mobile app to enhance brand identity, it will be amazing fact to invest on us too.

At this moment, there are no exactly the same product like Bill Easy in the market. Bill Easy acts as the alternative to tablets installed for placing dine-in orders, a POS, a white-label mobile app for placing take-away orders and a CRM. Most importantly, it is easy to be integrated and very competitive in price. 

Direct mails will be broadcasted to local restaurants and let them initially have impression on Bill Easy. Search Engine Optimization and keyword advertising campaigns will be applied to the official site of Bill Easy too. At the same time, we will give free supports to 30 - 60 potential restaurant clients and cultivate some success stories for the future.

There are at least four channels to distribute Bill Easy: direct mails, banner advertisements in renowned food hunting / voting websites, business matching service provided by HKTDC and gatherings in Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants & Related Trades. In addition, some connections with F&B members are already made. There will be no obvious obstacles if we can offer free trials to some selected potential restaurants. 

## Current Stage of Development 

A prototype of QR Code scanning on mobile app is complete and the connection with the online database hosted in Amazon Cloud is fully functional. The printer can now print out the orders upon the online database. A full demonstration of ordering pipeline is ready.
